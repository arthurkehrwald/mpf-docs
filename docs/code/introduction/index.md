# Introduction

This introduction chapter should give you a quick start into extending MPF. Follow either the examples for the [machine wide](machine_code.md) extension or the [mode wide](mode_code.md) extension. In the next step most extensions probably have to deal in one or the other way with variables, follow this [variable guide](variables_in_code.md) to learn how to deal with MPF variables in your own code.

As long as you only write smaller extensions you don't have to setup a full Python development environment. Of course you can and the more complex your development gets the more handy it might be. The [setup guide](setup.md) you only have to follow if you really want to develop MPF itself and not only to write an extension for your game.

Last but not least of course the [API Reference](../api_reference/index.md) is very important for you.
